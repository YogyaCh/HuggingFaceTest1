# HuggingFaceTest1
Repo to try end-to-end MLOps using hugging face and GitHub actions.

## Tools Used:

**1. Gradio:**

* **Purpose:** A Python library used to create user interfaces for machine learning models.
* **Benefits:**
    * Simplifies the process of building interactive demos for machine learning models.
    * Allows for easy sharing and collaboration on projects.
    * Provides a user-friendly interface for non-technical users to interact with models.
* **How it works:** Gradio creates a web interface that allows users to input data, interact with the model, and visualize the output.

**2. Hugging Face:**

* **Purpose:** A platform and community focused on machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).
* **Features:**
    * Provides a vast collection of pre-trained models for various tasks, such as text generation, translation, and sentiment analysis.
    * Offers a user-friendly interface for exploring and using these models.
    * Facilitates collaboration and sharing of models and datasets within the community.
* **How it works:** Hugging Face provides a library and API that allows developers to easily access and use pre-trained models in their projects.

**3. Click Framework:**

* **Purpose:** A Python package for creating command-line interfaces (CLIs).
* **Benefits:**
    * Simplifies the process of building CLIs for Python scripts.
    * Provides a declarative syntax for defining CLI options and arguments.
    * Offers features like automatic help generation and argument validation.
* **How it works:** Click allows developers to define the structure of their CLI using Python functions and decorators. It then handles the parsing of command-line arguments and provides a clean and consistent interface for users to interact with the script.

**4. GitHub Actions** 

* **Purpose:** is a powerful automation platform built into GitHub that allows you to automate various tasks within your software development workflow. It provides a flexible way to create custom workflows triggered by events like code pushes, pull requests, or issues.
* **Benefits:**
  * Continuous integration (CI): Automatically build, test, and report on code changes.
  * Continuous delivery (CD): Deploy code changes to various environments like development, staging, and production.
  * Code quality checks: Run linters, formatters, and other tools to maintain code quality.
  * Project management: Automate tasks like issue labeling, milestone tracking, and release management.
  * Custom automation: Create workflows for any task that can be automated, such as generating documentation or sending notifications.

By leveraging GitHub Actions, you can streamline your development process, improve code quality, and reduce manual effort.
